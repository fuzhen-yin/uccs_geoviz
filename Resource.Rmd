> Penn State's Graduate Program for fully-funded positions on Cartography and Geovisualization

:::: {.blueborder data-latex=""}

The Department of Geography at Penn State is welcoming applications in the subfields of Cartography, Geovisualization, and GIScience to its resident Graduate MS & PhD programs. All admitted graduate students at Penn State Geography are fully-funded on either teaching or research assistantships. Multiple externally funded projects in cartography and geovisualization are ongoing and available to support qualified applicants with backgrounds in mapping, visualization, and GIScience. The Department is home to multiple GIScience research centers, including the GeoGraphics Lab. Applications are due December 1, 2024. 

Please review our website for full details on how to begin your application: https://www.geog.psu.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions-and-aid/how-apply-our-resident-graduate-program 

We invite prospective students to join us for an upcoming webinar information session about our graduate program on Tuesday, October 22nd 5:00pm - 6:00pm EDT. Register here to participate: tinyurl.com/psugeoginfo 

Applicants should indicate subfield interests in Cartography, Geographic Information Science, and Spatial Data Science on the application form, as well as suggesting professors Anthony Robinson and Cynthia Brewer as specific people you might work with (these steps will ensure that applicants in cartography/viz are able to be prioritized â€“ it does not require you to work with those advisors). All complete applications that are submitted on or before the application deadline are reviewed by the graduate program admissions committee, made up of faculty spanning the major subfields of geography. This committee works together to review and evaluate all applications, and after developing an overall ranking for the applicant pool, potential advisors listed on the application are brought in to provide additional feedback on top overall candidates.

If you have questions, please contact Anthony Robinson at arobinson@psu.edu.
