### 5.1 Lab Goals

This chapter continues to explore the techniques and analyses related to map-making. In [Chapter 4](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab4.html), we have played with census data (e.g., tables and cartographic boundaries) to make choropleth maps. Today, we will use [AirBnb data](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) as an example to learn more advanced spatial analysis skills including:

* **Converting** .csv file to spatial data 
* **Spatial joining** 
* Mapping and analyzing **point** data
* Using **functions** in R
