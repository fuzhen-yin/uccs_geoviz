### 2.1 Lab Goals 

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

* Assign a variable and view its  
* Understand what are different data types and how they are used in the context of geo-visualization
* Clean, calculate and manipulate different data types 

### 2.2 Good Practice

#### 2.2.1 Organizing Folders 
Let's first navigate to the course folder that we have created for the previous lab (see [Chapter 1.2](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab1.html#12_Good_Practice_-_Organizing_Folders)), and create a folder called **lab2**. 


#### 2.2.2 Housekeeping

We'll use RStudio again for this chapter. Please open RStudio as we have explained in  [Chapter 1.3](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab1.html#13_Launching_RStudio). 

(*Note: all computers in COH 329 should have an updated RStudio already*). 

Before starting any works, please make sure you are in fresh **new project** with a **blank script**. Please follow the action checklist below: 

* Step 1: Is the previous project "Lab 1" closed? 
  + If *not*, please close it by go to *File* --> *Close Project* --> *Save* changes. 
* Step 2: Create a **New Project** using **Existing Directory**, navigate to **lab2**, click **open**, then **Create Project**. 
* Step 3: Create a **New Script** by go to **File** --> **New File** --> **R Script**. **Save** the script by giving it a proper name.

At this step, you should see something similar to Figure 2.1. If you have any questions about the above steps, please refer to [Chapter 1.3: Launching RStudio](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab1.html#13_Launching_RStudio) for detailed instructions.

### 2.3 Intro to Programming using R

R is a mixture of programming paragrams (Cotton, 2013). At its core, it is an **imperative language**. 

> An **imperative language** provides step-by-step instructions for a computer to perform a task. Your write a script that does one calculation after another. Therefore, the order to run codes in your script can affect outcomes.

But it is also supports **object-oriented programming** and **functional programming**. 

> **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code. Data in the form of fields (e.g., variables) and code in the form of procedures. 

> **Functional programming** is constructed by applying and composing functions. In R functions are first-class objects. You can treat them like any other variable and call them recursively.

### 2.3.1 Variables & Data Types

Let's create some variables. 
*Note: the codes below are pretty simple. Please try to re-write them by yourself and understand the purpose of each line.*


a) **Integers (int)** are whole numbers, e.g., 1, 10, -10. Run the code below and observe what do you see in the **Environment** panel on the top-right corner (see Figure 2.2). Do you see a new variable *"var_int"*?
```{r}
var_int <- 99
```

![Figure 2.2: Monitoring the environment panel.](figs/lab2_environment_new_var.png)

<br>
We can also create consecutive integers by using the symbol ``` : ``` 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# create consecutive integers 
var_ints <- -5:5

# let's check this variable
print(var_ints)
```

**Note:**

* The symbol ``` # ``` is used to write comments. Comments are completed ignored by R and just there to make the code more readable.  \
* The shortcut to write ``` <- ``` is ``` Ctrl ``` + ``` - ``` .

b) **Other numerics** such as the floating-point number (float) often includes a decimal point, e.g., 3,14, -99,99, 5.0. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Let's create floats by using the coordinates of UCCS as an example
var_long <- -104.801     
var_lat <- 38.892    
```

c) **Characters** are used to store text (also called "strings"). To indicate something is a character, we put *quotation marks* around it ``` "" ```.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Create a character to indicate a city name. 
var_char <- "Colorado Springs"

# Check the class of this variable "var_char"
class(var_char)
```

d) The **Logical** class only has two possible values: ``` TRUE ``` or ``` FALSE ```. They can also be written as ``` T ``` or ``` F ```, but never *true* or *false* because R programming is *case-sensitive*. Logicals are useful to evaluate logical statements. 
```{r}
# We can ask the machine to compare numbers. For example, we assign values to "a" and "b".
a <- -5
b <- 5

# Then, we ask the machine to compare the two values. 
a > b
```


e) A **vector** is an ordered set of values by using the function ``` c() ```. Vectors are extremely important in statistics and data science, since we usually want to analyze a whole dataset rather than just a piece of data. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Vector can include a series of numeric values, by specifying them one by one
var_vec_num1 <- c(1,3,5,7,9,-11)
var_vec_num1

# or by using the symbol : to create consecutive integers 
var_vec_num2 <- c(1:10, -99:-95)
var_vec_num2

# Vector can also include characters
var_vec_char <- c("Colorado Springs", "Denver", "Bouder", "Aurora")
var_vec_char

# or a mix of characters and numeric values 
var_vec_mix <- c(1,3,5, "Aspen", "Pueble", 99)
var_vec_mix
```
