R is the based app to process R programming language, and RStudio integrates with R to provide further functionality such as graphical user interface (GUI). We need to install both **R** and **RStudio** for this workshop. \

### 2. Good Practice - Organizing Folders  

It happens to me all the time that my course A files are mixed with course B's. 
To make things easier, I highly recommend organizing your folders in the following way: 

* Create a folder specifically for this course (e.g., Geoviz_fall_2024). 
* Under the course folder, create a series of sub-folders for different labs and assignments separately, for example, folders with  "lab1", "lab2", "lab3"....."assignment1", "assignment2"....(see Figure 1.1)
* For each lab, work in that specific folder. For example, for this lab, you could work in the "lab1" folder under the "Geoviz_fall_2024" course folder.  \
