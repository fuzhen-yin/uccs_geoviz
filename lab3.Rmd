### 3.1 Lab Goals 

This chapter aims to introduce the complete workflow of data analysis and visualization using R. After reading it, you should be able to:

* **import** data from local files 
* **clean** and **transforming** data, such as: 
  + extract data corpus 
  + join and merge data frames 
  + understand sorting and ordering 
* **draw** standard plots including:
  + histograms
  + bar charts 
  + line plots
  + scatter plots 
* **export** plots in different formats and know the differences between different formats 

### 3.2 Good Practice 

Okay, I guess you already know what I am going to repeat. However, there are something [new]{.ul} for this lab. I will try to be brief :) 


#### 3.2.1 Organizing Folders & Sub-folders

Similar to what we have done in previous labs, under the course folder, please create a folder called "**lab 3**". Next, in the **lab3** folder, please create two [sub-folders]{.ul} that one is called "**data**" and another one is "**plot**". 
We'll use the "**data**" folder to store data collected from the internet. The "**plot**" will be used to export plots generated from R. 

After created these folders, your folders should look similar to Figure 3.1.

#### 3.2.2 Housekeeping & Launching RStudio
Again, we would like to start a **new project** from scratch with a **clean R Script**. Please do the following steps. If you have any questions about these steps, please refer to the previous chapters for help. 

* Step 1: Make sure all existing R projects are **properly closed**. 
    + If *not*, please close it by going to *File* --> *Close Project* --> *Save* changes (see [Chapter 2.5](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab2.html#25_Close__Exit)). 
* Step 2: Create a **New Project** using **Existing Directory**, navigate to **lab3**, click **open**, then **Create Project**. (see [Chapter 1.3](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab1.html#13_Launching_RStudio)). 
* Step 3: Create a **New Script** by go to **File** --> **New File** --> **R Script**. **Save** the script by giving it a proper name.
