### 3.1 Lab Goals 

This chapter aims to introduce the complete workflow of data analysis and visualization using R. After reading it, you should be able to:

* **import** data from local files 
* **clean** and **transforming** data, such as: 
  + extract data corpus 
  + join and merge data frames 
  + understand sorting and ordering 
* **draw** standard plots including:
  + histograms
  + bar charts 
  + line plots
  + scatter plots 
* **export** plots in different formats and know the differences between different formats 

### 3.2 Good Practice 

Okay, I guess you already know what I am going to repeat. However, there are something [new]{.ul} for this lab. I will try to be brief :) 


#### 3.2.1 Organizing Folders & Sub-folders

Similar to what we have done in previous labs, under the course folder, please create a folder called "**lab 3**". Next, in the **lab3** folder, please create two [sub-folders]{.ul} that one is called "**data**" and another one is "**plot**". 
We'll use the "**data**" folder to store data collected from the internet. The "**plot**" will be used to export plots generated from R. 

After created these folders, your folders should look similar to Figure 3.1.

#### 3.2.2 Housekeeping & Launching RStudio
Again, we would like to start a **new project** from scratch with a **clean R Script**. Please do the following steps. If you have any questions about these steps, please refer to the previous chapters for help. 

* Step 1: Make sure all existing R projects are **properly closed**. 
    + If *not*, please close it by going to *File* --> *Close Project* --> *Save* changes (see [Chapter 2.5](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab2.html#25_Close__Exit)). 
* Step 2: Create a **New Project** using **Existing Directory**, navigate to **lab3**, click **open**, then **Create Project**. (see [Chapter 1.3](https://fuzhen-yin.github.io/uccs_geoviz/lab1.html#13_Launching_RStudio)). 
* Step 3: Create a **New Script** by go to **File** --> **New File** --> **R Script**. **Save** the script by giving it a proper name.


#### 3.2.3 Heads-Up

[**Heads-Up!**]{.ul}
:::

This is a pretty **long tutorial** but it will guide you through a complete workflow of data analysis and visualization. As you can imagine, this will be a steep learning curve. Please take _regular breaks_. 

This tutorial covers most of the techniques for **Assignment 2**. Please try to:

* Re-write the script by yourself. 
* Read through the text carefully and try to understand what bits of code are doing as you go. 
* It's okay that you don't fully understand some codes. Don't worry as the key is to revisit later and try to work out what is going on. Learning (R or others) is a iterative process. 
* Start to think about how you can adapt a particular line of code or functions for your own script. 
* Be CURIOUS!! Ask QUESTIONS!! Discuss with FRIENDS!!
